### Simba_Basic
Simba_Basic is an early stage prototype for an industrial control system simulation and design tool.
Users are able to create their own Python Modules which are used to preform custom operations on a set of jQuery data that is loaded into the tool.
The modified jQuery data is then given a tag classifed by the operations preformed, and can be either saved to a local file system or be made as a HTTP POST request as a payload.

### Current Support
The default url assembly is configured primarly for the ease of GridState use. However, data can be GET/POST from any url location as long as the host follows the same REST structure.

Currently the only supported response type is JSON.
